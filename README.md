# An AI Model used for Lip syncing
Where its used to to synchronize an audio file with video file


Pretrained model used here is :- `Wav2Lip + GAN`
For better visual quality and good syncing for lips

############# Primary Programming  Language used here is `Python 3.6` on the `COOLAB NOTEBOOK` ###########

## Requirements
---> The config and the pretrained model from [Wave2LIP](https://github.com/justinjohn0306/Wav2Lip).
---> Audio file and video file with path address

## Process
----> Clone the pretrained model from the above repo
---->Mount the video file and the audio file(For rezizing and adding resolution to standard 720p)
---->These 2 files will be uploaded to sample data after resizing
---->Run the code for Crunching and mapping the files for the result

## Result
Resultant video will also be preveiwed and can also download the video from given directory mentioned on the output

## Common mistakes
--->Video file exeeds 60 sec // As it consumes time in a normal pc//
--->Video frames Shouldnt consist any blank visuls are inpresence of the target person
